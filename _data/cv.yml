    - title: Satellite LoRa signal enhancement based on C-RAN
      institution: Project leader
      year: 2024.3 - Present
      description:
        - The project focuses on enhancing satellite LoRa signals based on C-RAN, aiming to develop an innovative integrated communication solution for space and earth using the Beijing Post-2 satellite. Combining the processing capabilities of C-RAN with the coverage advantages of satellite communication, it aims to enhance ground terminal signals, expand the communication range and reliability of IoT devices. The experimental platform has been built, based on the collection and processing of LoRa signals from low Earth orbit meteorological satellites. Multiple LoRaWAN gateways are used for coherent combination detection of weak signals that cannot be decoded on any single gateway.
    
    - title: Cross technology Communication(CTC) Based on Channel Disturbance (Huawei Collaborative Research Project)
      institution: Core team
      year: 2023.9 - 2024.1
      description:
        - The project focuses on achieving direct communication between different communication technologies through channel perturbation. My job is to develop a communication decoding program that uses WiFi devices to sense signals emitted by ZigBee nodes based on existing research results, and optimize the bit error rate to below 10%. Based on technologies such as c-Chirp, I implement single channel and multi-channel decoding programs and improve the robustness of the system.
